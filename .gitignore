# Wait, for PHP production without build step on server, we might WANT dist committed.
# But usually best practice is to build on server. 
# However, user requested "upload to github" and "host for free".
# Free hosts usually don't run npm install/build.
# So we SHOULD commit dist folder.
# Removing dist from ignore for this specific user case.
